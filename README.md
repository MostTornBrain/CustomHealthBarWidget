# CustomHealthBarWidget
 Add Healthbar configuration options to the Fantasy Grounds CoreRPG ruleset.
 
 When this extension is enabled, there will be a new set of options that allow customizing a few aspects of the healthbar:
 
 1) Toggle a background health bar that shows what 100% health would be
 2) Set the horizontal offset for how far away from the token the bar appears
 3) Set the overall width of the bar, making it easier to see when zoomed out
 4) Choose "Light" or "Dark" mode for the bakcground coloring of the bar.
